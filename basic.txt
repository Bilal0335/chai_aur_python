Mutable means something that can be changed.
Immutable means something that cannot be changed.

Example:

let x = 10;
let y = x;

console.log(x); // Output: 10
console.log(y); // Output: 10

x = 15;

console.log(x); // Output: 15
console.log(y); // Output: 10



Explanation:

Initially, both x and y have the value 10.

When x is changed to 15, y remains 10 because it was assigned the value of x before x was changed.

This demonstrates how x is mutable (it can be changed), and how assigning x to y creates a separate copy of the value.
